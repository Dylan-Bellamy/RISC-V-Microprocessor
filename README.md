# RISC-V-Microprocessor

## Tools Used
[Gowin IDE](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-Doc/install-the-ide.html):
While there are many great IDE's out there such as Vivado and Quartus, I choose to use Gowin's IDE as I wish to eventually implement the RISC-V microprocessor onto a [Tang Nano 9K](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-9K/Nano-9K.html) and it's an easily setup making it very beginner friendly. If you wish to install or buy a Tang Nano 9K FPGA, I've attached links that you'd find helpful.
